The VISIT_DETAIL table is an optional table used to represents details of each record in the parent VISIT_OCCURRENCE table. A good example of this would be the movement between units in a hospital during an inpatient stay or claim lines associated with a one insurance claim. For every record in the VISIT_OCCURRENCE table there may be 0 or more records in the VISIT_DETAIL table with a 1:n relationship where n may be 0. The VISIT_DETAIL table is structurally very similar to VISIT_OCCURRENCE table and belongs to the visit domain.
