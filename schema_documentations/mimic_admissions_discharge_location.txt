admission_location provides information about the location of the patient prior to arriving at the hospital. Note that as the emergency room is technically a clinic, patients who are admitted via the emergency room usually have it as their admission location. Similarly, discharge_location is the disposition of the patient after they are discharged from the hospital. Association with UB-04 billing codes admission_location and discharge_location are associated with internal hospital ibax codes which arenâ€™t provided in MIMIC-IV. These internal codes tend to align with UB-04 billing codes. In some cases more than one internal code is associated with a given admission_location and discharge_location. This can either be do to; 1) multiple codes being used by the hospital for the same admission_location or discharge_location, or 2) during de-identification multiple internal codes may be combined into a single admission_location or discharge_location. In the tables below, we provide the matching UB-04 code(s) for the most common ibax codes for a given admission_location and discharge_location, when applicable. In cases where more than one code is given, if this combination is due to 1) in the above paragraph, the additional code must have at least 10% of the entires of the most common code.
