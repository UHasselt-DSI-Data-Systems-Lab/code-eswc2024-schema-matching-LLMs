There will only be one provider per visit record and the ETL document should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.). If there are multiple providers associated with a visit in the source, this can be reflected in the event tables (CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, etc.) or in the VISIT_DETAIL table.
