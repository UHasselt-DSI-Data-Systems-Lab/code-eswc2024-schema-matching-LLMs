admit_provider_id provides an anonymous identifier for the provider who admitted the patient. Provider identifiers follow a consistent pattern: the letter “P”, followed by either three numbers, followed by two letters or two numbers. For example, “P003AB”, “P00102”, “P1248B”, etc. Provider identifiers are randomly generated and do not have any inherent meaning aside from uniquely identifying the same provider across the database.
