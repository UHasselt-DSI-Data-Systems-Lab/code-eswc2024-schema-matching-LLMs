parent_field_ordinal delineates multiple administrations for the same eMar event, e.g. multiple formulary doses for the full dose. As eMAR requires the administrating provider to scan a barcode for each formulary provided to the patient, it is often the case that multiple rows in emar_detail correspond to a single row in emar (e.g. multiple pills are administered which add up to the desired dose). The structure for emar_detail rows is as follows: There is one row per eMAR order with a NULL parent_field_ordinal: this row usually contains the desired dose for the administration. Afterward, if there are N formulary doses, parent_field_ordinal will take values ‘1.1’, ‘1.2’, …, ‘1.N’. The most common case occurs when there is only one formulary dose per medication. In this case the emar_id will have two rows in the emar_detail table: one with a NULL value for parent_field_ordinal (usually providing the dose due), and one row with a value of ‘1.1’ for parent_field_ordinal (usually providing the actual dose administered).
