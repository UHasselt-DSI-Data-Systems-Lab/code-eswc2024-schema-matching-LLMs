The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships between Concepts are stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher level ancestry connections, all individual direct relationships would have to be navigated at analysis time. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includes records for all parent-child relationships, as well as grandparent-grandchild relationships and those of any other level of lineage. Using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for querying for all descendants of a hierarchical concept. For example, drug ingredients and drug products are all descendants of a drug class ancestor.
