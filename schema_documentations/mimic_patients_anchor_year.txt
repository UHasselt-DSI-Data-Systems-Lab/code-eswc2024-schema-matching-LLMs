These columns provide information regarding the actual patient year for the patient admission, and the patient’s age at that time. anchor_year is a shifted year for the patient. anchor_year_group is a range of years - the patient’s anchor_year occurred during this range. anchor_age is the patient’s age in the anchor_year. If a patient’s anchor_age is over 89 in the anchor_year then their anchor_age is set to 91, regardless of how old they actually were. Example: a patient has an anchor_year of 2153, anchor_year_group of 2008 - 2010, and an anchor_age of 60.  The year 2153 for the patient corresponds to 2008, 2009, or 2010. The patient was 60 in the shifted year of 2153, i.e. they were 60 in 2008, 2009, or 2010. A patient admission in 2154 will occur in 2009-2011, an admission in 2155 will occur in 2010-2012, and so on.
