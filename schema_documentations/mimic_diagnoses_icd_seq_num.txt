The priority assigned to the diagnoses. The priority can be interpreted as a ranking of which diagnoses are “important”, but many caveats to this broad statement exist. For example, patients who are diagnosed with sepsis must have sepsis as their 2nd billed condition. The 1st billed condition must be the infectious agent. There’s also less importance placed on ranking low priority diagnoses “correctly” (as there may be no correct ordering of the priority of the 5th - 10th diagnosis codes, for example).
