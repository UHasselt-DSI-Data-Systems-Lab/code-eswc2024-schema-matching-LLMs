It is possible that some records destined for the Observation table have two clinical ideas represented in one source code. This is common with ICD10 codes that describe a family history of some Condition, for example. In OMOP the Vocabulary breaks these two clinical ideas into two codes; one becomes the OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID and the other becomes the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID. It is important when using the Observation table to keep this possibility in mind and to examine the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID field for relevant information.
