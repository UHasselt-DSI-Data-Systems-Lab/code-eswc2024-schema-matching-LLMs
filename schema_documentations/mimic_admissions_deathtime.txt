admittime provides the date and time the patient was admitted to the hospital, while dischtime provides the date and time the patient was discharged from the hospital. If applicable, deathtime provides the time of in-hospital death for the patient. Note that deathtime is only present if the patient died in-hospital, and is almost always the same as the patientâ€™s dischtime. However, there can be some discrepancies due to typographical errors.
