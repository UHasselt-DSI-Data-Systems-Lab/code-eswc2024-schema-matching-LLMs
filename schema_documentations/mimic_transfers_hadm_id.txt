Identifiers which specify the patient: subject_id is unique to a patient, hadm_id is unique to a patient hospital stay, and transfer_id is unique to a patient physical location. Note that stay_id present in the icustays and edstays tables is derived from transfer_id. For example, three contiguous ICU stays will have three separate transfer_id for each distinct physical location (e.g. a patient could move from one bed to another). The entire stay will have a single stay_id, whih will be equal to the transfer_id of the first physical location.
