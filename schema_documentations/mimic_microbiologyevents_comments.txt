Deidentified free-text comments associated with the microbiology measurement. Usually these provide information about the sample, whether any notifications were made to care providers regarding the results, considerations for interpretation, or in some cases the comments contain the result of the measurement itself. Comments which have been fully deidentified (i.e. no information content retained) are present as three underscores: ___. A NULL comment indicates no comment was made for the row.
