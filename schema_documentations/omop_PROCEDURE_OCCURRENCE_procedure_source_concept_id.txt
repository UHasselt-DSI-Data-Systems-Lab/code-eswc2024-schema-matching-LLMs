This is the concept representing the procedure source value and may not necessarily be standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the Procedure necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using PROCEDURE_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network.
