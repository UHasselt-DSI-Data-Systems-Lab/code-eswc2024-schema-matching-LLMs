The services table describes the service that a patient was admitted under. While a patient can be physicially located at a given ICU type (say MICU), they are not necessarily being cared for by the team which staffs the MICU. This can happen due to a number of reasons, including bed shortage. The services table should be used if interested in identifying the type of service a patient is receiving in the hospital. For example, if interested in identifying surgical patients, the recommended method is searching for patients admitted under a surgical service.
