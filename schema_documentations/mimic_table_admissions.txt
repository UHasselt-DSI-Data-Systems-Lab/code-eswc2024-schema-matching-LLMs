The admissions table gives information regarding a patientâ€™s admission to the hospital. Since each unique hospital visit for a patient is assigned a unique hadm_id, the admissions table can be considered as a definition table for hadm_id. Information available includes timing information for admission and discharge, demographic information, the source of the admission, and so on.
