icd_code is the International Coding Definitions (ICD) code. There are two versions for this coding system: version 9 (ICD-9) and version 10 (ICD-10). These can be differentiated using the icd_version column. In general, ICD-10 codes are more detailed, though code mappings (or “cross-walks”) exist which convert ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes. Both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes are often presented with a decimal. This decimal is not required for interpretation of an ICD code; i.e. the icd_code of ‘0010’ is equivalent to ‘001.0’. ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes have distinct formats: ICD-9 codes are 5 character long strings which are entirely numeric (with the exception of codes prefixed with “E” or “V” which are used for external causes of injury or supplemental classification). Importantly, ICD-9 codes are retained as strings in the database as the leading 0s in codes are meaningful. ICD-10 codes are 3-7 characters long and always prefixed by a letter followed by a set of numeric values.
