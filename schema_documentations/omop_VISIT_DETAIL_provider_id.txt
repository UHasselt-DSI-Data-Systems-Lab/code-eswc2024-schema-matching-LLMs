There will only be one provider per visit record and the ETL document should clearly state how they were chosen (attending, admitting, etc.). This is a typical reason for leveraging the VISIT_DETAIL table as even though each VISIT_DETAIL record can only have one provider, there is no limit to the number of VISIT_DETAIL records that can be associated to a VISIT_OCCURRENCE record.
