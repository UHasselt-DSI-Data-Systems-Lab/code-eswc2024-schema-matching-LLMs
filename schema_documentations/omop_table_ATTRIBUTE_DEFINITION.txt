The ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION table contains records to define each attribute through an associated description and syntax. Attributes are derived elements that can be selected or calculated for a subject within a cohort. The ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION table provides a standardized structure for maintaining the rules governing the calculation of covariates for a subject in a cohort, and can store operational programming code to instantiate the attributes for a given cohort within the OMOP Common Data Model.
